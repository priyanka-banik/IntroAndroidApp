# IntroAndroidApp
This repository is for basic Android App Development for a beginner which has front end only(till now).
After a lot of trials and experiments done with various widgets in Flutter,i ended up making this beautiful intro app of mine, which is basically implementing and adjusting of container,colors,cards(with icons) and Avatar as well.
This app contains a brief description of me shown both on Chrome Web and Android Device(YOUR PHYSICAL DEVICE).
Editor used-VISUAL STUDIO.
